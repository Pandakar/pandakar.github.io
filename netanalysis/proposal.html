Proposal

<p>
Most video games featuring multiplayer modes have moved from local multiplayer setups to
online multiplayer setups. In a local setting the performance of the game was only reliant on the
game itself but over the Internet multiplayer games face several network-reliant performance
issues. Players in these multiplayer games, such as Starcraft or League of Legends, want
connections that are both fast and stable. Since games in different genres have different
constraints on the number of players and game duration, our focus will be limited to the genre of
fighting action games. These games, such as Street Fighter or Marvel vs. Capcom, are played
as 1v1 setups and can be conducted as peer-to-peer sessions. Games in this genre also
require fast and stable setups, as games can be won off minor differences in input frames.

There have been efforts put in by the gaming community to introduce middleware that attempts
to improve the reliability of fighting action games. Currently there are two such middleware
platforms: GGPO and FightCade. There has also been research conducted 1 2 and presented
through the annual NetGames conference, but this conference has not presented any papers on
fighting action games in particular. Papers have been presented on detecting and reducing lag
as well as analyses of similar video game genres, but few exist for fighting action games.

<p>
This project aims to give a technical breakdown of how middleware such as GGPO and
FightCade improves the network performance and/or reliability of fighting action games.
Furthermore, this project also aims to compare the network performance of fighting action
games that use middleware like GGPO with fighting action games that do not use middleware.
These comparisons would be conducted through packet captures from which various statistics
(such as RTT and drop rate) would be computed over the duration of gaming sessions.

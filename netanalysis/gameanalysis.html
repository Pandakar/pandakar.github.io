<h2> Game Architecture and Packet Analysis </h2>
  <p>
    This page contains links to videos and packet captures from their respective games.
    While the overall results of these comparison experiments are inconclusive,
    observing how various fighting games tackle their netplay architecture is still an interesting endeavour.
  </p>

  <p>
    Videos were captured using <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">Open Broadcasting Software.</a>
    The packets used for analysis were captured using <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank">Wireshark.</a>
    To force unfavorable latency where normally unavailable, the tool Clumsy was used.
  </p>

  <h3>Using Clumsy to Force Unfavorable Latency</h3>

  <p>
    Clumsy is an open-source tool that uses the WinDivert library to interact with packets.
    Clumsy can be found <a href="https://jagt.github.io/clumsy/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    A demo of Clumsy's interface can be seen in the following GIF.
  </p>
    <img src="https://jagt.github.io/clumsy/clumsy-demo.gif" alt="Clusmy in action" />
  <p>
    Amongst other features, this software can perform the following functions on Windows systems:
    <ul>
      <li>forcing lag</li>
      <li>dropping packets</li>
      <li>throttling connections</li>
      <li>duplicating packets</li>
      <li>sending packets out-of-order</li>
      <li>tampering with checksums</li>
    </ul>
    The primary features used in the following tests were forcing lag and dropping packets. Attempting to use the other features resulted in undesired game crashes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Equivalents of Clumsy are readily available for other operating systems as well.
    For similar functionality in OSX, you would want to use <a href="http://nshipster.com/network-link-conditioner/" target="_blank">Network Link Conditioner.</a>
    For Linux, <a href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/netem" target="_blank">netem</a> would be the tool of choice.
  </p>

  <h3> Analysis on Skullgirls </h3>

  <p>
    Skullgirls uses peer-to-peer for all of its netplay functionality and uses UDP to transmit all packets.
    This is partially due to the usage of the GGPO middleware for part of its network stack.
    When playing online, players can participate using Tournament Mode, Local Only (for LAN tournaments/games), Quick Match (random matches against other online players) or Lobby Play.
    For the purposes of this project, Lobby Play was setup with a peer in Australia for stress testing Skullgirls' usage of GGPO.
  </p>

  <h4> Packet Capture Analysis </h4>

  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>two packet capture files taken, total size of 33MB from 9 matches</li>
    <li>packet lengths in 40-319 range, 90% are in 80-159 range</li>
    <li>10.75% of packets had to explicitly traverse through NAT, assuming this to be lobby setup and idling</li>
    <li>while users in lobby, PING/PONG messages periodically sent between lobby members as a keep-alive</li>
  </ul>

  <h4> Video Highlights </h4>
    The following list of links showcases the notable test matches played.
  </p>
    <!-- insert video links here -->
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92_V-KW-DW8" target="_blank">223ms, frame delay set to 8 on both sides</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2IBQg-RInk" target="_blank">243ms, frame_delay set to 0 on both sides</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fbcgZsshkY" target="_blank">380ms, frame_delay set to 8 on host side.</a>Game saw longer load times and match ending discrepancy</li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6msDsCVpnbs" target="_blank">Match end discrepancy mentioned above</a></li>
      </ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFtmsgHmNpo" target="_blank">400ms, frame_delay set to 0 on both sides.</a> Lots of frame skipping and sound duplication can be seen.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJy8tZn7qMo" target="_blank">223ms, frame_delay set to 0 on both sides.</a> Packet loss of 20% forced on host end.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EbeD4_ml4" target="_blank">320ms, frame_delay set to 5 on host side.</a> Game is slightly smoother but slow-paced with infrequent input drops.</li>
    </ol>

  <p>
    Attempts at matches with more than 20% packet loss were made, but the game would crash either on attempts to load or during the game.
    Attempts above 400ms also resulted in similar crashes.
  </p>


  <h3> Analysis on Street Fighter V </h3>

  <p>
    Attempts at analysing Street Fighter V's traffic were not as successful.
    Information regarding Street Fighter V's server setup were gathered but analysis from the actual matches is unreliable.
  </p>

  <h4> Assumed Server Architecture </h4>
  <p>
    On starting the game, the following server information is sent to the Steam client as a JSON message.
    <ul>
      <li>"Game": {"DNS": "api.prod.capcomfighters.net", "Port": "80"}</li>
      <li>"STUN1": {"DNS": "stun1.prod.capcomfighters.net", "Port": "23478"}</li>
      <li>"STUN2": {"DNS": "stun1.prod.capcomfighters.net","Port": "33478"}</li>
      <li>"Message": {"DNS": "message.prod.capcomfighters.net","Port": "20002"}</li>
      <li>"File": {"DNS": "fdlcdn.prod.capcomfighters.net","Port": "80"}</li>
      <li>"Proud": {"DNS": "209.58.132.134","Port": "30850"}</li>
    </ul>
    Capcom
  </p>

    <li>uses combination of server/client for authentication and peer-to-peer for lobby play</li>
    <li>while sitting in lobby, dgrams sent back and forth between lobby players with following format:</li>
    <!-- image of wireshark here -->
    <li>while sitting in lobby, heatmap in background being periodically updated from fileserver through plaintext HTTP requests</li>
  </ul>

  </ol>
  <li> Identified middleware to conduct analyses on:</li>
  <ol>
    <li> GGPO </li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.fightcade.com/"> FightCade </a> </li>
  </ol>

  <li> Acquired second computer for capturing packets off LAN </li>
</ul>

Since GGPO's site has been offline since it was first visited, analysis of middleware will be conducted entirely from FightCade.
